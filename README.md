## About The Project

This project was developed as part of the UCD Master's in Computer Science. It focuses on displaying useful real-time and predicted data about the bike stations of Dublin Bikes, a bike rental service operating in Dublin.

The application does the following:
* Represents each bike station (with a pin) on a map interface.
* Utilises real-time information to display current bike and bike stand availability for each station.
* Uses trained models to predict future availability of bike and bike stands, as well as weather patterns in Dublin.
